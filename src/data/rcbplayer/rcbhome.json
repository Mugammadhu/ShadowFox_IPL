    "noCup":"RCB (Royal Challengers Bangalore) has indeed faced challenges in clinching the IPL championship despite consistently participating in all seasons. They reached the finals in 2009, 2011, and the 2016 IPL editions. Additionally, they qualified for the playoffs in the 2020 and 2021 seasons. However, there seems to be a typo with \"2020\" repeated twice. It should be corrected to \"2020, 2021,2022,and 2023 IPL seasons.\""
