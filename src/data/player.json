Ahead of the 2022 edition of the league, MS Dhoni was one of the four retained players by the franchise and he was retained for a sum of INR 12 crore. A batting powerhouse, MS Dhoni possesses the ability to destroy different bowling attacks on his own. The calmness and composure in his demeanor along with a sharp cricketing brain accounts for a lethal combination on the cricketing field and the glistening silverware in the trophy cabinets at CSK are a testimony to his extraordinary leadership skills. He was the face of Chennai Super Kings for the first eight editions of the league, leading them to two titles (2010 & 2011) and four runner-up finishes. He then became the first player to be drafted by Rising Pune Supergiant in the ninth edition of the league. And, he once again became the first player to be retained by CSK ahead of the IPL Player Auction 2018. The 2018 season of the league had a fairytale ending with another glistening silverware added to the trophy cabinet of the Chennai Super Kings. The 2019 edition of the league too saw the CSK reach the finals of the tournament under MS Dhoni’s leadership. While MS Dhoni has hung up his boots on a 16-year illustrious career for Team India, he was seen donning the CSK colours once again in 2020.",

Ravindra Jadeja has always been MS Dhoni’s go-to-man when he needed to break a partnership and the left-armer has delivered the goods on many occasions. His presence gives Dhoni the extra cushion of playing an additional batsman if needed. Jadeja has been an enigma right since his advent in international cricket. He was part of the victorious Indian U-19 cricket team that won the World Cup in Malaysia in 2008. His performance in IPL 2008 helped Rajasthan Royals to title victory and earned him the nickname \"Rockstar\" by his captain Shane Warne. In 2012 IPL player auction, Jadeja was bought by Chennai Super Kings for approx. Rs. 9.8 Crore, making him the most expensive player of the year's auction. Jadeja has represented the Gujarat Lions for two seasons and was back with CSK for the eleventh edition of the league. He has been an integral part of them ever since.",

A smart spinner and a handy batter, Santner was bought by CSK for INR 1.9 crore at the 2022 Mega Auction. In 2018, Santner was bought by the CSK for just INR 50 lacs, the Kiwi bowler was definitely one of the most economical buys for CSK. Santner made his debut for New Zealand when Daniel Vettori retired from his ranks and in only his first game, Santner impressed the selectors, not with the ball, but with the bat. Since his debut, Santner has been an impressive prospect although he’s had his share of ups and downs in world cricket. Santner is a handy batter lower down the order and an outstanding fielder.",

What started from his base price 50 lakhs and owing to a lot of interest for this all-rounder in the auction, it went upto INR 4 cr for Dube. The all-rounder who hails from Mumbai has been making headlines for his gritty batting and bowling efforts. Shivam Dube had played junior cricket for his state before making it to the Mumbai senior team. He made his Twenty20 debut for Mumbai in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy in January 2016 and a year later made his one-day debut for the state team. On the eve of the Player Auction prior to IPL 2019, Dube made headlines as he hammered five sixes in five balls off left-arm spinner Swapnil Singh on the final day of Mumbai’s Ranji Trophy match against Baroda. Not surprisingly, he attracted fierce bidding at the auction and was eventually signed up by by the Royal Challengers Bangalore for a fee of INR 5 cr. After playing for Royal Challengers Bangalore over the course of IPL 2019 and IPL 2020, Shivam Dube was brought on board by Rajasthan Royals for INR 4.40 Cr. The Indian all-rounder has a reputation of being a clean hitter of the cricket ball and can be handy with the ball with his medium pace. Dube, who has played 24 IPL games, will be eager to shine bright for the Chennai franchise in the IPL 2022.",

It was as if the CSK had decided to get their man back into the ranks and finally succeeded in the same with a price of INR 14 crore. The Agra-born medium pacer, Deepak Chahar was a part of the Rajasthan Royals squad in 2012, donned the RPS jersey for two seasons and was bought by the Chennai Super Kings in the eleventh edition of the league. Chahar has risen through the ranks and his ability to swing the new ball both ways with control is what makes him a lot more lethal at the top. Chahar also possesses the ability to hit handy runs lower down the order and his current exploits, a match winning knock against Sri Lanka and a 34 ball 54 against South Africa has been the talk of the town. Ahead of the 2018 season, Deepak was picked by the Chennai Super Kings and medium-pacer had a breakthrough 2018 IPL season taking 10 wickets in 12 matches. He was then subsequently rewarded with an India call-up in limited-overs cricket.",

    "about": "Mustafizur Rahman is a left-arm pace bowler who came to Dhaka in 2012 to try his luck at a fast-bowler’s camp, after he had impressed in an Under-17 tournament in his hometown Satkhira. He was admitted to the Bangladesh Cricket Board's pace foundation and soon caught the coaches' attention to make the Bangladesh Under-19 side for the 2014 World Cup. He initially lacked pace, but built it up through the 2014-15 first-class season, when he took 26 wickets. An international call up came soon and Mustafizur impressed straightaway making some of the best in the business look tentative against him. He enjoyed great success against India in the Asia Cup in 2016 and caught the eye worldwide for his ability to generate good pace and for his deceptive slower one. The IPL 2016 was his first stint with the IPL and he was known for his lethal yorker to KKR all-rounder Andre Russell. He was impressive for SRH last year and would be looking to do well in the 2017 edition as well. RR acquired Mustafizur's services after bringing him on the board for INR 1 Cr. The left-arm pacer from Bangladesh has thus far played five IPL seasons and has 46 IPL wickets to his name and he will be looking to add a few more wickets to his tally as the Delhi Capitals look to clinch the title in TATA IPL 2023.",

    "about": "On March 12, 2022 the former RCB Skipper, Virat Kohli announced that he would be passing on the baton tow Faf du Plessis, who will be the new Captain for the RCB. It will be an all new setup, change in team colours for Faf du Plessis who will be representing the RCB the 2022 edition of the league. The veteran batter from South Africa was bought by the RCB for INR 7 crore at the IPL 2022 Mega Auction. Faf du Plessis started his IPL journey with the CSK and has played for them ever since. The right-handed batter played an all-important knock in the Finals of the 2021 edition of the league, scoring 86 runs off 59 deliveries, thereby winning the Player of the Match for the same. In 2018, Punjab Kings bought Faf for INR 1.6cr, but but CSK trumped them by using their RTM card and it sure was a bargain for them. While the classy and composed batsman did not get many outings in the RPS squad where he was picked up in the IPL player draft, du Plessis had consistent performances for CSK wherein he went on to have a very successful debut season scoring 398 runs. He impressed with a half-century on his ODI debut, against India and soon enough, found himself in South Africa’s squad for the 2011 World Cup. With a century on Test debut against Australia, du Plessis has shed the tag of a limited-overs specialist. Although batting remains his area of prowess, du Plessis can come up with a few handy leg-spinners when required. To boot that, he is a livewire in the field, hence, making him a perfect T20 package for any captain.",
